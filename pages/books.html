<h1>The Books That Started the Magic</h1>
<p>
    The Harry Potter series is where the magic began — seven unforgettable
    books that transported millions of readers into a world of friendship,
    bravery, and the battle between good and evil.
</p>

    Written by J.K. Rowling, the series follows the journey of Harry Potter,
    a young wizard who discovers his true heritage on his eleventh birthday
    and embarks on a life-changing adventure at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
    and Wizardry.

    Each book peels back new layers of the wizarding world, from secret
    chambers and deadly tournaments to hidden horcruxes and final battles.
    Alongside Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Harry faces growing threats,
    uncovers powerful truths, and learns the value of loyalty, love,
    and sacrifice.
