<h1>Spells & Charms of the Wizarding World</h1>
<p>
    Magic in the Harry Potter universe isn't just wondrous — it's practical, 
    powerful, and deeply woven into everyday wizarding life. 
    From levitating objects to defending against dark forces, 
    spells are at the heart of what it means to be a witch or wizard.
</p>
<p>
    Wizards train for years to master incantations, wand movements, 
    and magical intent. Some spells are simple and harmless, 
    others highly advanced — or even dangerous. Every charm, curse, 
    and jinx serves a unique purpose, and every spell has a story.
